# Advent Calendar 2021
My collection of 2021's advent coding challenges.

## Advent of GraphQL

**Website**: https://descriptive-snout-e43.notion.site/Advent-of-GraphQL-c69086ae98764e2e9e1ccdd8938dc980

**Description**: A new challenge is unlocked every day. You'll start by making your first query, then move on to making more complex queries in our GraphQL Studio. By the end of the month, you'll have deployed a customized schema to an endpoint you created with StepZen to return a random snowflake from the Unsplash API! ❄️
